# WPA_Competition

2-9-25 Update:
- All 8 files/tables have been cleaned and uploaded to repo
- All utilized Python notebooks have been uploaded to repo
- Created sample_df that has WPA_id where new_job == 1, skillup_find_new_job == 1 and there was at least one match between main_reason_ and new_job_ categories.
- Current shape is over 19,000 records and over 178 columns - we will need to reduce dimension for better predictive modeling

Next Steps:
- Dimension reduction techniques
- Handle imbalanced data between target classifier
- Predictive modeling
- Review findings
