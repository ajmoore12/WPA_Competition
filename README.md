# WPA_Competition

2-17-25 Update:
- Completed skillup_feature sentiment analysis for "unsuccessful" with skillup_recommend score <= 7
- PowerPoint being edited by BM
- Finishing Tableau Visuals
- Deep Learning Model completed

Next Steps:
- Complete all project deliverables
- Submit the project to WPAC
- Await next steps if qualify for virtual finals

2-16-25
- Continue Tableau Visuals and modify existing visuals
- PowerPoint Construction beginning
- Deep Learning Model being modified

Next Steps:
- Perform sentiment analysis on skillup_feature
- Create specific visuals to show compare and contrast of high-income and low-income (based on living wage)
- Investigate why Four-year degree holders are engaging in training more

2-13-25
- All EDA completed
- Trends analysis completed
- Project plan amended

Next Steps:
- Deep Learning Model
- Begin PowerPoint Outline
- Further transformations and insightful feature engineering
- Mock-up Tableau Visuals

2-9-25 Update:
- All 8 files/tables have been cleaned; most tables are too large to upload to GitHub
- Notebooks for EDA have been uploaded in Code
- Created sample_df that has WPA_id where new_job == 1, skillup_find_new_job == 1 and there was at least one match between main_reason_ and new_job_ categories.
- Current shape is over 19,000 records and over 178 columns - we will need to reduce dimensions for better predictive modeling

Next Steps:
- Dimension reduction techniques
- Handle imbalanced data between target classifier
- Predictive modeling
- Review findings
